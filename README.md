Student Enrollment Form

Description
This form takes following things as Input:
1. Student Roll Number 
2. Student Name
3. Student Class
4. Student Birth Date
5. Student Address
6. Student Enrollment Number 

After entering the above data it saves that data in the data base made in JSONPowerDB.

Database Name - STU-DB
Relation Name - StuData

This form works on some set of rules
1. If Roll Number is not present in data or we can say if new Roll Number is added it takes all the data and enebles the SAVE, CHANGE and RESET Button.
2. If a Roll Number is already present in the data base it enables only CHANGE button and disabled SAVE and RESET button so that if we want to modify that data we can modify it.
In this database primary key is Student Roll number.
